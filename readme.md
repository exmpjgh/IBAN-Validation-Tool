## Project Structure

The project consists of the following pieces:

- **Input**
  A text field where users can enter an IBAN from Montenegro
- **Validation**
  After the user enters an IBAN, the application should be able to validate the IBAN and show whether it is valid or invalid.
- **Display the result**
  Show the user the result of the IBAN validation by using a clear visual representation that indicates whether the IBAN is valid or not.
- **Real-time validation**
  Add the ability to validate IBANs in real-time as they are entered. Show the user during the input if the IBAN is valid or not so far.
- **Validation history**
  Implement a feature that stores and displays the last IBAN validations performed. Display a list of validated IBANs along with their validation status and when they were validated.
- **Suggest the correct IBAN**
  Suggests the correct IBAN from previous attempts.
